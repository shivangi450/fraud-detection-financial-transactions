# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo and create a new branch.
2. Make your changes (keep them small and well-scoped).
3. Run the notebook end-to-end to ensure it still works.
4. Open a pull request describing what you changed and why.

## Style
- Prefer clear variable names and simple functions.
- Add short comments for non-obvious logic.
